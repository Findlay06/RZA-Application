2. Install poetry

poetry new <gui_project_name> && cd <gui_project_name>
poetry add tkdesigner
poetry install

3. To run Tkinter Designer from the source code, follow the instructions below.

Download the source files for Tkinter Designer by downloading it manually or using GIT.

git clone https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer.git

Change your working directory to Tkinter Designer.

cd Tkinter-Designer

Install the necessary dependencies by running:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

In the event that pip doesn't work, also try the following commands:

- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

OR:

- python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user
- PY -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user
If this still doesn't work, ensure that Python is added to the PATH.

## Troubleshooting

Files don't work?

- Please make sure that the paths for each file are changed to your path.

Buttons will not lead to other files once clicked?

- Make sure that each button has been set to the correct path as well.

Files don't work due to imports?

- Make sure the requirements from the text file in the Tkinter-Designer folder have been installed.

Assets not found?

- Make sure the assets have been included in the same build/version folder.

Fonts don't work?

- The fonts file path needs to be linked to the accessibility file.

Something else?

- Refer to this page: https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer/issues
